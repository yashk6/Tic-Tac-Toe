# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player board game that is played on a 3x3 grid. The objective of the game is simple: players take turns marking a square on the grid with either an "X" or an "O" in an attempt to get three of their marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
